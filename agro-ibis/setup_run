#!/bin/bash

# Usage: setup_run path
#
# Makes directory with given path name; makes necessary output folders;
# copies ibis.infile, and makes symbolic links to executable and other
# input files.
#
# This allows you to perform multiple runs simultaneously without
# worrying about them overwriting each other's outputs.
#
# Note: The current behavior (as of 7-12-10) is to make a copy of
# ibis.infile, but to make links to the executable and all other
# parameter & input files. This behavior makes sense if the only thing
# that differs between runs is ibis.infile. However, if you are doing
# runs with, say, different parameter values in some of the params.*
# files, then you will probably want to change the behavior to make
# copies of these files rather than links. Similarly, if the
# executable differs between runs, then you will probably want to
# change the script to make a copy of the executable rather than a
# link to it.
