This README file last updated: Feb. 11, 2010

The files in this directory describe the characteristics of the possible
climate data sets that can be used as input to Agro-IBIS. The name of
each file corresponds to the possible values of the datasource input
parameter. The appropriate file is read by the subroutine
read_input_description.

The files are formatted as Fortran namelists. Any parameters not set
explicitly will take on default values as specified in
read_input_description.

Some notes on the format of these files:
- Comments begin with '!'.
- The first non-comment line must be '&input_description', which is
the name of the namelist.
- Parameters are defined as PARAM_NAME = VALUE
- The file should be terminated with '/'

When adding a new variable to these files, you should change:
- This README file
- read_input_description.f: Add the variable to the namelist and to the
initialization section
- cominput.h: Add a variable declaration and put the variable in one of
the existing common blocks or in a new common block
- Any input description file for which the value differs from its
default

Note: When changing which climate data set you're using, you often will
also have to change some values in comgrid.h (nlon, nlat, xres, yres,
etc.). These variables are defined in comgrid.h rather than in these
input files because they are needed at compile time to create arrays of
the proper size.

--- read_daily_directly ---

If TRUE, we read daily values directly. In this case, we do not do
anything with monthly timeseries (but we still require files giving
monthly climatologies). This means:

	- nanom (in this input description file) should be 0

	- iyranom should equal iyrdaily (in ibis.infile)


If FALSE, we read separate files containing daily anomaly values, and
apply these anomalies to the monthly values. (Or we only use monthly
values, and use the weather generator to generate daily values.)


--- one_file_per_year ---

If TRUE, there is a separate input file for each year for the daily
data (the monthly data are still all contained in a single file).

If FALSE, all years are contained in the same input file.


--- read_tmin_tmax ---

If TRUE, we read tmin and tmax directly.

If FALSE, we read tmean and trange, and calculate estimated values of
tmin and tmax.


--- read_radiation ---

If TRUE, we read incoming radiation directly.

If FALSE, we read cloud cover fraction and calculate estimated
values of incoming radiation.


--- correct_sphumid ---

If TRUE, we do corrections of specific humidity that I (WJS) believe are
intended for when the input data are averages of observed relative
humidity (as opposed to, say, averages of specific humidity observations
that were then converted to averages of RH). These corrections correct
for covariances between RH and temperature. These corrections were
originally implemented for monthly humidity observations (with
anomalies); I'm not positive that they are applicable when
read_daily_directly = TRUE.

Note: Although it is possible to set both correct_sphumid = TRUE and
conserve_tdew = TRUE, generally only one (or neither) should be TRUE.
correct_sphumid is intended (I think) for when the input data are
derived from averages of observed relative humidity, whereas
conserve_tdew is intended for when the input data are derived from
averages of the observed dewpoint temperature.


--- conserve_tdew ---

If TRUE, conserve daily mean dewpoint temperature rather than daily mean
specific humidity when creating the diurnal cycle of humidity. This is
intended for datasets where the humidity input was derived from daily
averages of the observed dewpoint temperature.

If FALSE, conserve daily mean specific humidity when creating the
diurnal cycle of humidity.

Note: Although it is possible to set both correct_sphumid = TRUE and
conserve_tdew = TRUE, generally only one (or neither) should be TRUE.
correct_sphumid is intended (I think) for when the input data are
derived from averages of observed relative humidity, whereas
conserve_tdew is intended for when the input data are derived from
averages of the observed dewpoint temperature.


--- istyrm ---

First year monthly values exist in monthly timeseries files (if these
files are present).


--- nanom ---

Number of years in monthly timeseries files (if these files are present)


--- istyrd ---

First year daily values exist in daily timeseries files.


--- nanomd ---

Number of years in each daily timeseries file if one_file_per_year =
FALSE, or number of years of daily timeseries files if one_file_per_year
= TRUE.


--- level_var ---

Name of level variable (if any) in the input files.


--- INPUT FILE NAMES ---

These file names should specify the name of all input climate files,
giving the full path relative to the input directory. 

It is okay for some file names not to be specified, but in this case the
file name will be set to ' ', and no file will be read for that
variable. This can be the case for files that are not used with the
given data set (e.g., 'cloud' when read_radiation is TRUE); it can also
be the case for monthly timeseries - in this case, we use the monthly
climatologies in place of a monthly timeseries for this variable.
However, all required input files must be specified.

Note that these file names should NOT contain the trailing '.nc'; also,
for one_file_per_year = TRUE, they also should NOT contain the _YYYY
suffix.

Example: A file name of zedx/daily/tmax would read in files of the form
input/zedx/daily/tmax_1948.nc, input/zedx/daily/tmax_1949.nc, etc.
(assuming that one_file_per_year = TRUE).

The variables are of the form:

fn_<VAR>_<RESOLUTION>

(exception: fn_tminavgann: this file has a single time slice, for the
annual climatology)

<RESOLUTION> is one of:

_mon_clim: monthly climatologies (12 times in the file)

_mon: monthly timeseries (12*nyears times in the file); only used if
read_daily_directly is false

_daily: daily timeseries

	- If read_daily_directly is false, these give anomalies rather
	than the actual daily values.

	- If one_file_per_year is true, the actual file names will be of
	the form fn_<VAR>_<RESOLUTION>_<YYYY>.nc, and will contain 365
	or 366 times

	- If one_file_per_year is true, the actual file names will be of
	the form fn_<VAR>_<RESOLUTION>.nc, and will contain
	approximately 365.25*nyears times


<VAR> is one of:

cloud: cloud cover (percent)

	- Only used if read_radiation is false

rads: solar radiation (W m-2)

	- Only used if read_radiation is true

temp: average temperature (degrees C)

	- Only used if read_tmin_tmax is false

dtr: diurnal temperature range (degrees C)

	- Only used if read_tmin_tmax is false

tmin: daily min. temperature (degrees C)

	- Only used if read_tmin_tmax is true

tmax: daily max. temperature (degrees C)

	- Only used if read_tmin_tmax is true

prec: precipitation rate (mm/day)

rh: relative humidity (percent)

wspd: wind speed (m/s)

wetd: wet days per month

	- Only used in weather generator. Thus, we never have a daily
          version of this file.

tminavgann: Average daily minimum air temperature (degrees C)

	- This file has a single time slice: it is an annual climatology

	- This variable name does not have a <RESOLUTION> suffix: it is
          simply fn_tminavgann


--- INPUT VARIABLE NAMES ---

There is one input variable name for each input file name, giving the
name of the data variable in that file.

If not specified, these variable names are set to the default values as
specified in the read_input_description subroutine.
