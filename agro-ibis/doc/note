# Things to check (search Y.Li for location)
- snow.f: fi(i), potentially devided by zero fi(i)
- solute.f: wisoi(i,k), potentially devided by zero wisoi(i,k)
- crops.f: lai(i,1), potentially devided by zero lai(i,1) <-- avglail = 0 <-- [plai(i,13), plai(i,14), plai(i,15)] = 0. It seems the code only consider pft type 13, 14, and 15.
- crops.f: rdm, potentially devided by zero rdm <-- [dmleaf,dmstem] = 0
- stats.f: adaet(i), potentially devided by zero adaet(i)
- canopy.f: tg(i), potentially devided by zero tg(i)

# Potential errors (which usually are ignored by the set up of the compiler, yet they are there)
- io.f : subroutine <wdaily> "write(tdate(1:3),'(i3)') nday", output conversion error, <nday> can easiliy be > 1000

# code (to add comment upon commit)
- 2015-07-07: modify netcdf utilities (readvar) for compatability and better user info

# <npoi>: total number of land points defined in "comgrid.f". 
1) the code assumes <nlonsub>*<nlatsub> == <npoi>

# <lmask>: indicator for land surface (0:water; 1:land). read-in from "surta.nc". used by:
1) <nlpoints> is then counted as number of land points of the grid.
2) function <arr2vec> to put <array> to <vect> when <lmask> == 1
3) In both 1) and 2), if <nlpoints> != <npoi>, the program is set to stop
4)
