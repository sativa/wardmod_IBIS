This file contains a list of things that should be done.

WJS (4-16-10): Fix what I believe is a potential bug in the code to loop
through files. There could be problems when we try to read a leap year
in a non leap-year, or vice versa. See my comment about this in io.f :
rdday.

WJS (5-16-10): Check the uncertainties mentioned in the log message
for r119. These are:

  - Should respiration be changed in the period between maturity and
    harvest? I haven't modified anything respiration-related, and I
    don't *think* that anything is done with croplive with respect to
    respiration (e.g., root respiration). Should we, for example, turn
    off root respiration after maturity?

  - When winter wheat is killed due to cold temperatures (croplive(i,15)
    is set to 0), should anything else be done here, like setting
    croppresent to 0, or setting harvdate?

  - Right now, the nstress-related code in subroutine nitrostress
    (crops.f) is not executed between maturity and harvest. That is, it
    depends on croplive. Should this be changed to depend on
    croppresent???

  - In solute.f, I have fin=fertnitro happen when croppresent = 1;
    should this be changed to happen when croplive = 1? (Which is used
    in solute.f should probably be consistent with which is used in
    subroutine planting, in the conditional deciding whether to
    fertilize. But it actually probably doesn't matter whether I use
    croppresent or croplive in these two places.)


WJS (6-30-10): Change the calculation of 'absorb' in stats.f to use
the proper parameters (i.e., green vs. brown). I am not entirely sure
this is necessary, but at a glance, it looks like it should be done.

WJS (7-12-10): Retune some things based on the new GDD formulation -
both because we are now using gdd_crop_modified rather than
gdd_crop_tmean, and because we are now using a base temperature of 10C
rather than 8C for corn. Some things that may need to be retuned or
otherwise modified are the following (but there may be other things as
well):

  - How the length of the crop seasons are determined in crops.f (in the
    planting_prognostic subroutine): the 0.8, 0.9 and 1.2 factors that
    are multiplied by gddcorn may no longer be appropriate. This is
    especially true for the soybean and wheat factors (0.8 and 1.2,
    respectively), since we have changed the base for corn GDD
    accumulation, but the base for soybean and wheat GDD accumulation is
    still the same as before.

  - hybgdd in params.crp: max GDD means something slightly different
    with this new GDD formulation

  - lfemerg in params.crp: with the new GDD formulation, this fraction
    might have to be changed slightly to give about the same number of
    days from planting to emergence that was obtained in the old code

  - grnfill parameter in params.crp: this might have to be adjusted
    slightly to maintain a good split between the number of days in the
    vegetative and reproductive periods. This might be especially true
    for corn, for which the CRM-based corrections rely on the value of
    gddmaturity, which will be different with the new GDD function.



WJS (7-12-10): Test the new gdd formulation (gdd_crop_modified) when the
model is run using met station data (i.e., in dailymet). In particular,
I'm not positive that tmin and tmax are set appropriately before the
call to dailymet.

WJS (7-12-10): Change the daystoharv parameter for wheat to be non-zero
(in params.crp). It's possible that this should be split into two
parameters, one for spring wheat and one for winter wheat, as is done
for many other wheat parameters.

WJS (8-4-10): For management_prescribed=TRUE, the input files and code
should be changed so that the variables (planting.date, total.gdd,
etc.) are specified separately for each crop type. Currently, the same
variables apply regardless of the crop type being used. This was fine
for my simulations, which only used maize. But it means that, in order
to do a simulation with a different crop type, you need to change the
input files, either by moving files around, or by changing the values
of the planting_input and cultivar_input variables in
ibis.infile. Perhaps more importantly, it also means that you
currently cannot use crop rotations in conjunction with
management_prescribed=TRUE.

  - If this is fixed, you can delete the comments in crops.f beginning
    with "Note that there is a single..." (As of 8-4-10, I believe
    there are 3 such comments - search for 'there is a single')
