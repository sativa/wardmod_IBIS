# Configuration options for makefile
# Note: if you change anything in here, you should run 'make clean' before running 'make'
# N.B.: No error checking is done, so be sure not to make any typos!

# Declare your version ID here; this is just used for make tardist

VERSION = AgroIBIS.miss.8.2.2006

# Choose your compiler here; this will determine which compiler flags get set
# Valid options are 'ifort', 'xlf' and 'gfortran'

#MY_FC = gfortran
MY_FC = ifort

# Choose your optimization level here
# Valid options are 'opt', 'O0' and 'debug', 'BigMem', 'BigRed2'
# What each of these options does depends on the compiler
#
# (Y.Li) When error occurs (such as "relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_PC32")
# for compiling large npoi in comgrid.f using ifort, try OPT = BigMem
# OPT = BigRed2 is the BigMem version specifically for BigRed2 at IU 

#OPT = O0
OPT = BigRed2

# Add any non-standard 'include' directories here, e.g.:
# INCLUDES = -I/usr/local/include
# Recommendation: replace /usr/local/include with the location of 'netcdf.inc' on your system

#INCLUDES = -I/usr/local/include
#INCLUDES = -I/opt/local/include
#INCLUDES = -I/opt/netcdf-fortran-intel/include
INCLUDES = -I/opt/cray/netcdf/4.3.3.1/INTEL/140/include

# Add any non-standard library directories here, e.g.:
# LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib

#LIBS = 
#LIBS = -L/opt/local/lib
#LIBS = -L/opt/netcdf-fortran-intel/lib -L/opt/local/lib
LIBS = -L/opt/cray/netcdf/4.3.3.1/INTEL/140/lib -lnetcdff -L/opt/cray/hdf5/1.8.14/INTEL/140/lib -lnetcdf

# Add any extra options here, to personalize your compilation experience
# MY_F_OPTIONS: used when compiling FORTRAN code
# MY_LD_OPTIONS: used when linking
# Some recommendations:
# - For 64-bit ifort: add '-diag-disable vec' (without the quotes) to both MY_F_OPTIONS and MY_LD_OPTIONS
# - For 64-bit gfortran: add '-m64' (without the quotes) to both MY_F_OPTIONS and MY_LD_OPTIONS

#MY_F_OPTIONS = -check all -g -debug all  -fpe0 -traceback  #(debug setup)
#MY_LD_OPTIONS = 

#MY_F_OPTIONS = -m64
#MY_LD_OPTIONS = -m64

MY_F_OPTIONS = -diag-disable vec 
MY_LD_OPTIONS = -diag-disable vec

#MY_F_OPTIONS = -diag-disable vec -check all -g -debug all  -fpe0 -traceback
#MY_LD_OPTIONS = -diag-disable vec -check all -g -debug all  -fpe0 -traceback
